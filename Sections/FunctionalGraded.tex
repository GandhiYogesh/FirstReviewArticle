\section{functionally graded anisotropic material}
Fused deposition modeling (FDM) additive manufacturing technology allows the manufacture of FRC structures with continuous yet spatially varying fiber paths, thus bringing considerably larger design freedom to novel design methods \cite{Fernandez2019,Jiang2019,Chandrasekhar2020}
